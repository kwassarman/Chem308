# Particle in a Box TDSE

The general set up of PIB for The Time Dependent Schrödinger Equations is similar to that of The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation. 

## Matlab
Matlab can be used to plot the wavefunctions that are dependent on both position and time. Three plots are shown:

  1. Wavefunciton in position basis over time in real and imaginary
    
  2. Wavefunction in energy basis over time in real and imaginary
    
  3. Probability density of position in real and shows expectation value and average energy.
    
Multiple states can be looked at together.
