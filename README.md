# Topics in Physical Chemistry

## Bates College

### Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
This is a chemistry class that builds upon the topics learned in quantum chemistry. It utilizes Matlab to visualize different models in quantum chemistry, such as particle in a box, harmonic oscillators, etc. In addition, linear algebra is used to represent operators as matrices and quantum states as vectors.
