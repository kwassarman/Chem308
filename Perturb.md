# Introduction to Perturbation Theory

Perturbation theory uses simpler problems and ideas in order to solve a more complex problem. This is useful in quantum mechanics because most of the calculations to understand a system are too complicated. Therefore, in order to understand a system, simpler models can be added together to build the more complicated system. 

One example of this problem is looking at the wavefunctions of a $H_2^+$ molecule because there are three particles in the system. Perturbation theory can be used in order to determine the wavefunctions by combining the wavefunctions for each hydrogen separately. Below is a picture of combining the wavefunctions of each hydrogen atom to create the molecular orbitals of $H_2^+$.

The left well and right well represent the left and right hydrogen atoms. And the central barrier represents the $H_2^+$ molecule. The central barrier system shows the wavefunctions for the system at different energies. This is a linear combination of the left well and right well. Each level represents a bonding and an anti-bonding orbital. For example, the lowest energy level, which represents the s-orbitals, has an orange wavefunction and a blue wavefunction. The orange wavefunction shows the hydrogen atoms out of phase and therefore is an anti-bonding orbital ($\sigma ^ {\ast}$). The blue wavefunction shows the hydrogen atoms in phase and is the bonding orbital ($\sigma$).As state of each of the individual atoms increases, the states go from $1s \rightarrow 2s \rightarrow 2p \ldots$. Therefore, as the states increase, the amount of energy separation between the bonding and anti-bonding increase. 

Below shows the contribution of each hydrogen atom to the $H_2^+$ molecule. The lowest energy shows negative contribution of the left well and positive contribution of the right well with the same magnitude. Therefore, the wavefunctions of the right and left wells are in the same phase. This represents the bonding orbital between the $1s$ from each hydrogen atom.

In order to more fully understand this topic, below is the picture of the orbitals presented in introductory chemistry. It is the MO theory picture of the atomic orbitals combining to create the molecular orbitals. This picture only shows the $1s$ orbitals because this is the ground state occupied by the only electron.

Again, the $1s$ $\sigma$ can be represented by a linear combination of the wavefunctions of each of the hydrogen $1s$ orbitals. This helps to better understand the $H_2^+$ molecule from previously determined wavefunctions without needing to define a new model to represent the molecule.
