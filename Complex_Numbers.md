# Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are important for quantum mechanics when looking at the Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation because as time progresses, the position goes in a spiral between real and imaginary numbers. 

**Complex numbers** are in the form $$n=a+ib$$ where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are real numbers and $$i=sqrt(-1)$$. $$a$$ is considered the real part of the number $$n$$ and $$ib$$ is the imaginary part. The complex conjugate of $$n$$, $$n^.$$, is $$n^.=a-ib$$. Complex numbers are useful for expressing the probability density $$|\psi|^2 = \psi^.\psi$$. 

The Euler Identity is important in quantum mechanics and allows for $$e^{ix}$$ functions to be separated into the real and imaginary compenents. The following is the identity,

$$e^{ix} = cos(x)+isin(x).$$

Later when looking at The Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation, this identity is useful.
