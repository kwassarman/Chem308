# Linear Algebra Basics

Linear algebra is the natural language of quantum mechanics, so it is important to understand basic concepts of linear algebra. This opening page can be used as a reference point when looking at the rest of the webpage. For quantum mechanics, wavefunctions are expressed as vectors and operators are expressed as matrices (more explained later). Below are different linear algebra concepts that are useful.

## Vectors

There are two kinds of vectors (1) row and (2) column vectors. Row vectors are 1 x m dimensions and consist of a row with m elements, $\begin{pmatrix} \\y\end{pmatrix}$... Column vectors are m x 1 dimensions and consist of a column with m elements, 
\[\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
\vdots\\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}\].
Different operations can be done on vectors. Scalar multiplication changes all the elements in a vector by the product of the element and the scalar. Given a scalar $c$ and a vector $\vec v$, we define the product $c \vec v$ by $$c\begin{pmatrix} x\\y \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} cx\\cy\end{pmatrix}.$$ Therefore, scalar multiplicaiton is pretty intuitive.
