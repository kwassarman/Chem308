# The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)

As the name describes, the time independent Schrödinger only depends on space and is indepdent of time. The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states or stationary states can be determined by the equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction. The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator give the energy level of a specific stationary state.
