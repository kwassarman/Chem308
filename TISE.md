# The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)

As the name describes, the time independent Schrödinger only depends on space and is indepdent of time. The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states or stationary states can be determined by the equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction. The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator give the energy level of a specific stationary state.

 

# The Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)

The time dependent Schrödinger describes all physically realizable states, and is defined by the equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tdse}
    \mathcal{H}\Psi(x,t) = E\Psi(x,t)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator formed by the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and  $$\Psi(x,t)$$ is a time- and space-dependent wavefunction.

Space and time are separable in the wavefunction if and only if $$\Psi(x,t)$$ satisfies the time independent Schrödinger equation ($$\mathcal{H}$$$$\Psi$$=E$$\Psi$$). And if the variables are separatble, then $$\Psi(x,t)$$ can be rewritten as,
\begin{equation}\label{separation}
    \psi(x,t)=\Psi(x)\mathcal{T(t)}
\end{equation}
where T(t) is always equal to exponential equation.
Therefore, the TDSE can be written as 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x,t) = psi(x,t)\e^{-i E_n t/\hbar}
 \end{equation}
if the variables are separable because the energy eigenfunctions are stationary.
