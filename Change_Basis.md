# Change of Basis

Changing the basis is useful in order to be able to do operations on a wavefunction. This is especially useful when using the time dependent Schr√∂dinger equation ([TDSE](TDSE.md)) for non-stationary states. These ideas are explained in more detail but this page is to help understand the basics behind change of basis. A vector can be expressed in different bases such as position, momentum, and energy. When a wavefunction, say $$\psi(x)$$, is operated on by $$\hat{H}$$ in the position basis, this operation occurs in its **natural basis**. This is because $$\psi(x)$$ is in terms of position and $$\hat{H}$$ is also in terms of position. Therefore after the operation, the result will be a detla function at the eigenvalue.
