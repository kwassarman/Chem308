# Molecular Dynamics

To further explore chemical bonding and reactivity on the quantum level, Matlab can be used to model reactions. One simple reaction that we observed was a substitution reaction as follows:

$$AB + C \rightarrow AC + B$$

This reaction was observed using three different surfaces that represent different conditions. The first was an early barrier:
