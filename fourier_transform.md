# Fourier Transform

Fourier transforms can be used to change from one basis to another such as time and frequency or position and wavenumber. Time ($t$) and wavenumber ($\omega$) are related by the fourier transform and have inverse units of seconds and inverse seconds, respectively. Also position ($x$) and wavenumber ($k$) are related by the fourier transform with units of meters and inverse meters, respectivley. Operations in one basis are often easier than the other, so it is a useful tool to perform difficult calculations. Later, this tool is used to calculate TDSE for more than one dimension and more than one particle. 

In order to do a Fourier Transform, you start with a function $f(x)$. Then you can transform this to yield $\hat {f}(x)$.
