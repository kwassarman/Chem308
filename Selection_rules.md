# Selection Rules

Only certain transitions between states are allowed because energy and momentum need to conserved. On this page the selection rules for vibrational transitions are explored. The basis for the transition between vibrational states has to do with an oscillating dipole moment. 

Below is a heat map for the vibrational transitions allowed for the harmonic potential example.

As you can see, only direct neighbor transitions are allowed, such as from $\nu = 1$ to $\nu = 2$. However, a transition from $\nu = 1$ to $\nu = 3$ is not allowed.
