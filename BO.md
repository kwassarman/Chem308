# Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

This approximation is used in order to separate the motion of the nucleus from the motion of the electron. The Schr√∂dinger equation cannot be solved for more than two bodies. This is known as the three body problem. Therefore, an assumption needs to be used in order to understand the mechanics of the system. 

The approximation assumes that the nucleus does not move when on the time scale of the electron. This is because the electron is about 1000 times smaller in mass than the nucleus, so the electron moves faster than the nucleus. 

The following are the steps to derive the Hamiltonian operator for a system containing two nuclei and an electron. The system is described more on [Chemical Bonding](/chemical_bonding.md).
